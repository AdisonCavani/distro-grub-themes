## Installation via GRUB Customizer

In order to clone the repository from GitHub, you have to install Git, via the `git` package.  
Alternatively, you can download a zip archive by clicking on **Code** then **Download ZIP**

#### Clone the repository

You can clone the repository or go to the [release page](https://github.com/AdisonCavani/distro-grub-themes/releases) and download a single theme.

### Install GRUB Customizer

<Callout type="warning">
  ``grub-customizer`` is not available on Ubuntu 21.10 and above.  
  See [#56](https://github.com/AdisonCavani/distro-grub-themes/issues/56).  
  You should [install it manually](#manual-installation), instead.
</Callout>

apt

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grub-customizer
```

pacman

```shell
sudo pacman -S grub-customizer
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Grub Customizer DOES NOT WORK on recent Fedora releases without extensive modification.  
  [Manually installing](#manual-installation) a GRUB theme is much more secure and hassle free.  
  Use this at your own risk.
</Callout>

dnf

```shell
sudo dnf install grub-customizer
```

eopkg

```shell
sudo eopkg install grub-customizer
```

  KDE Neon's default theme is set in a separate file that overrides any theme changes you make.  
  Run the following to disable the default GRUB theme:
  
  ```shell
  sudo rm /etc/default/grub.d/99_breeze-grub.cfg
  sudo update-grub
  ```
  
  To revert back to the orignal KDE Neon theme, open GRUB Customizer, and in the Appearance settings tab, change the theme dropdown back to breeze.

## Manual Installation

In order to clone the repository from GitHub, you have to install Git, via the `git` package.  
Alternatively, you can download a zip archive by clicking on **Code** then **Download ZIP**.

#### Clone the repository

You can clone the repository, or go to the [release page](https://github.com/AdisonCavani/distro-grub-themes/releases) and download a single theme.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AdisonCavani/distro-grub-themes.git
```

#### Create themes directory
To create themes directory, replace `BOOT_GRUB_LOCATION` with the directory where GRUB is located.  
Usually it's `/boot/grub` or `/boot/grub2` but some distributions have a different one, so you'll have to figure it out.

```shell
sudo mkdir BOOT_GRUB_LOCATION/themes
```

#### Edit or use a pre-made theme

```shell
cd distro-grub-themes/customize
```

#### Copy theme

The theme must be unpacked inside a folder before you can copy it.

```
sudo cp -r <theme_name>/ BOOT_GRUB_LOCATION/themes
```

#### Edit GRUB config

You can use your favourite text editor for this. Here, we use nano.

```shell
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Uncomment this line and set your display resolution:

```
GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080
```

Make sure ``GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"`` is commented out!

At the end of the file, add the path of your theme:

```
GRUB_THEME="BOOT_GRUB_LOCATION/themes/<theme_name>/theme.txt"
```

Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit.

#### Update Grub config

You'll need to tell GRUB to update its configuration in order to include the new theme.

##### Ubuntu and Debian-based systems:

```shell
sudo update-grub
```

##### Fedora, Arch & others: 


If you have a UEFI system, run:

```
sudo grub-mkconfig -o BOOT_GRUB_LOCATION/grub.cfg
```
or
```
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o BOOT_GRUB_LOCATION/grub.cfg
```

<Callout type="warning">
  These commands have only been tested on Arch & Fedora, and may not work on your distribution. Consult your distro's documentation and/or forum for the GRUB config file directory and its update commands.

## Install theme in Ventoy
