### Frequently Asked Questions
**Q**: Where are `psd` templates located?  
**A**: Templates are located in [`templates branch`](https://github.com/AdisonCavani/distro-grub-themes/tree/templates).

**Q**: How can I edit `psd` template? I don't have Photoshop  
**A**: You can import `psd` into GIMP, however this might cause to lose some Photoshop related data. I recommend to use [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) - free web-based Photoshop alternative.
